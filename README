ZedLog v0.1alpha
================

ZedLog is a robust cross-platform input logging tool (AKA a key 
logger).  It is based on a flexible data logging system which makes it 
easy to get the required data.  The current features include the 
following;

    -> All keyboard and mouse events.
    -> Full GUI
    -> Logging to file
    -> Basic hiding

Getting Started
===============

The ZedLog GUI is fairly intuitive but there is also full usage doc-
umentation under the help menu (or just press F1).

Development
===========

If you are a Java developer (or maybe a user who wants to help with 
documentation or something) and want help out with the development just
send me an email (below).  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
